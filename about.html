    <h1>About Reaper Threads</h1>
    <h2>Hi! My name is Abby.</h2>
    <p>I officially created Reaper Threads in 2020 during quarantine. I have been recreationally embroidering since 2018 and decided it was time to create a way to share my work.</p>
    <h3>Why Reaper Threads?</h3>
    <p>Originally I wanted to name my business after the the mythilogical fates, as they are known for creating, deciding and taking the lives of people through their spindle and thread. As a fan of mythology I love those concepts and their relation to thread. However, I was looking for a concept that was a bit darker and I have always had an interest in the Grimm Reaper, thus the name was born.</p>
